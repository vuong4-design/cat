# CatDesk Auto Approval

A small Chrome extension that auto click ChatGPT tool approval UI.

## Behavior

- Click the extension icon to toggle enabled / disabled.
- Enabled mode:
  - Watches `https://chatgpt.com/*` pages.
  - Detects ChatGPT tool approval cards.
  - Highlights the approval card, the negative button, and the primary approval button.
  - Click the approval button.
- Disabled mode:
  - Stops watching the page.
  - Removes all highlights and overlay labels.

## Selection strategy

The extension does not rely on the changing approval button text.

Instead, it finds a negative decision button such as `Deny`, `Cancel`, `Reject`, `Decline`, or `No`; finds the surrounding approval card; then selects the same-row button to the right of the negative button as the primary approval candidate.

The candidate is only highlighted and clicked when the surrounding card contains tool approval signals such as:

- `Using tools comes with risks`
- `Sharing data includes`
- `provided content`
- `create or overwrite`
- `sensitive`
- `workspace`
- `file`
